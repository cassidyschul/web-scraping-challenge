# web-scraping-challenge

## Deliverables
1. I created python scripts to scrape title and preview text from Mars news articles.
2. I scraped and analyzed Mars weather data from a website, organized the data into a dataframe, and created various data visualizations using pandas.

### Data Visualizations
![average_min_temp.png](https://github.com/cassidyschul/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Figures/average_min_temp.png?raw=true)
![average_min_temp_coldest_to_warmest.png](https://github.com/cassidyschul/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Figures/average_min_temp_coldest_to_warmest.png?raw=true)

Based on the data, month three has the lowest average temperature and month eight has the highest average temperature.

![average_pressure.png](https://github.com/cassidyschul/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Figures/average_pressure.png?raw=true)

As shown in the visualization, month six has the lowest average pressure and month nine has the highest average pressure.

![min_temp_terrestrial_days.png](https://github.com/cassidyschul/web-scraping-challenge/blob/main/Figures/min_temp_terrestrial_days.png?raw=true)

The plot shows that approximately 650 to 700 days exist in an Martian year.
